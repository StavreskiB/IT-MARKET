IT_MARKET
It market is a full-responsive project that was built by me personally from 0 to hosting. For this project I have used Bootstrap, Java and MySQL, database. For Java I used Spring Boot and Spring Security.

There are two types of users in the project, admin and regular user. Users can add a new product for sale, while admins must review and approve or reject it. 

The project contains a shopping cart and admin panel where new ads are approved, existing ads are deleted, users are blocked...
